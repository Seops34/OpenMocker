 * Mock HTTP call and response utilities for Phase 2.2 implementation.

 * Phase 2.2 Focus:
 * - MockerEngine implementation
 * - Request/response adapters
 * - Utility functions
 * - Unit tests
 *
 * Phase 3 Focus:
 * - Complete HttpResponse creation and integration
 * - Full plugin pipeline integration
 * - End-to-end testing with actual HTTP clients
 *
 * This approach allows us to implement and test the core mocking logic
 * while deferring the complex Ktor internal integration to Phase 3.
